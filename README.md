# 5. SQL Project: Analyze International Debt Statistics
In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. Use your data manipulation skills to find out which countries have the highest and lowest amounts of debt. You will answer the following questions:
1.  What is the number of distinct countries present in the database?
2.  What country has the highest amount of debt?
3.  What country has the lowest amount of principal repayments (indicated by the "DT.AMT.DLXF.CD" indicator code)?
